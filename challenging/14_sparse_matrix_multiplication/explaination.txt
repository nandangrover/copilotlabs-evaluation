Name: Sparse Matrix Multiplication

""" The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. We create a dictionary of nonzero cells for each matrix. The key is a tuple (i, j) that represents a cell in the matrix, and the value is the value of the cell. For example:
    dict_a = {
        (0, 1): 2,
        (1, 1): -3,
        (1, 2): 5,
    }
2. We iterate through the keys of the dictionary for matrix_a. For every key, we iterate through the columns of matrix_b. If the key in matrix_b exists, we add the value of the key in matrix_a multiplied by the value of the key in matrix_b to the corresponding cell in matrix_c.
3. We return matrix_c. """
