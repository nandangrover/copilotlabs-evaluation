Name: Http Server

* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. We import the go "fmt" and "net/http" packages, which are included with the go distribution.
2. We define the main() function, which is the entry point of our program.
3. We call http.HandleFunc() to register our HelloServer function as the handler function for the "/" URL pattern.
4. We call http.ListenAndServe() to start the web server listening on port 8080.
5. We define our HelloServer function, which responds to requests by writing the string "Hello, " plus the request path to the http.ResponseWriter object. */
