Name: Async Call

* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Declare a function called resolveAfter2Seconds() that returns a promise
2. Declare a new Promise() object, which is the return value of the function.
3. The Promise() object takes an argument, which is a function with one parameter, resolve. 
4. The setTimeout() function calls the resolve() function after two seconds.
5. Declare an async function called asyncCall().
6. Call the async function.
7. The async function calls the resolveAfter2Seconds() function.
8. The async function waits until the resolveAfter2Seconds() function returns a value.
9. The async function logs the value that was returned from the resolveAfter2Seconds() function. */
