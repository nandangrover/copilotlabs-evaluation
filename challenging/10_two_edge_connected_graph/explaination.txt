Name: Two edge connected graph

/* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. It checks if the graph represented by the edges is two-edge-connected.
2. If the graph is two-edge-connected, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
3. It does this by detecting if there are any bridges in the graph.
4. A bridge is an edge that, if removed, would cause the graph to become disconnected.
5. If there are no bridges, the graph is two-edge-connected.
6. It does this by using DFS to find the earliest arrival time of each vertex.
7. It also keeps track of the arrival time of each vertex's parent.
8. If a vertex has a child with an earlier arrival time, then there is a bridge.
9. If there is a bridge, the graph is not two-edge-connected.
10. It also returns false if a vertex is connected to itself. */
