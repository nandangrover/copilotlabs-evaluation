""" The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Sort the input list
2. Calculate the length of the sorted input list
3. Calculate the mean by summing the sorted input list and dividing it by the length of the list
4. Calculate the middle index of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2
5. Set the median to the middle index of the list by using list slicing
6. Check if the length of the list is even by checking if the length of the list divided by 2 has a remainder of 0
7. If the length of the list is even, set the middle number 1 to the middle index of the list by using list slicing
8. If the length of the list is even, set the middle number 2 to the middle index of the list plus 1 by using list slicing
9. If the length of the list is even, set the median to the sum of the middle number 1 and middle number 2 divided by 2
10. Set a dictionary of the number counts by using a dictionary comprehension
11. Set the mode to the key of the number counts dictionary that has the largest value
12. Calculate the sample variance by summing the list comprehension of the difference between each number and the mean squared and dividing it by one less than the length of the list
13. Calculate the sample standard deviation by raising the sample variance to the power of 0.5
14. Calculate the mean standard error by dividing the sample standard deviation by the length of the list to the power of 0.5
15. Calculate the z-score standard error by multiplying 1.96 by the mean standard error
16. Calculate the mean confidence interval by subtracting the z-score standard error from the mean and adding the z-score standard error to the mean
17. Return a dictionary of the mean, median, mode, sample variance, sample standard deviation, and mean confidence interval
18. Print the statistics dictionary """
