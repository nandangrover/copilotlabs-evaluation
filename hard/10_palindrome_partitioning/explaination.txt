Name: Traverse Graph

/* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Create a 2D array of booleans. Each boolean represents whether or not the substring from i to j is a palindrome.
2. Loop through the array and populate it with the base cases: substrings of length 1 are palindromes, and substrings of length 2 are palindromes if the first and last characters are the same.
3. Loop through the array and populate it with the recursive case: substrings of length 3 and greater are palindromes if the first and last characters are the same and the substring between them is a palindrome.
4. Create an array of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of cuts needed to make the substring from 0 to i a palindrome. The array is initialized with Infinity for each index, except for the first index, which is initialized with 0.
5. Loop through the array and populate it with the base case: if the substring from 0 to i is a palindrome, then the minimum number of cuts is 0.
6. Loop through the array and populate it with the recursive case: if the substring from 0 to i is not a palindrome, then the minimum number of cuts is the minimum of the minimum number of cuts for substrings from 0 to i minus 1 plus 1, and the minimum number of cuts for substrings from j to i plus 1, where j is the first index after 0 where the substring from j to i is a palindrome.
7. Return the minimum number of cuts needed to make the entire string a palindrome. */
