Name: Sorted Squares
/* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Create a function called taskAssignment that takes in 2 parameters, k and tasks.
2. Create a variable called pairedTasks and set it to an empty array.
3. Create a variable called taskDurationToIndices and set it to the return value of the getTaskDurationToIndices function, passing in tasks as the argument.
4. Create a variable called sortedTasks and set it to a copy of the tasks array, but sorted from least to greatest.
5. Create a for loop that iterates from 0 to k - 1, with i being the index.
6. Create a variable called task1Duration and set it to the value of sortedTasks at index i.
7. Create a variable called indicesWithTask1Duration and set it to the value of the key task1Duration in the taskDurationToIndices object.
8. Create a variable called task1Index and set it to the value of the last element in the indicesWithTask1Duration array.
9. Create a variable called task2SortedIndex and set it to the length of the tasks array - 1 - i.
10. Create a variable called task2Duration and set it to the value of sortedTasks at index task2SortedIndex.
11. Create a variable called indicesWithTask2Duration and set it to the value of the key task2Duration in the taskDurationToIndices object.
12. Create a variable called task2Index and set it to the value of the last element in the indicesWithTask2Duration array.
13. Push an array containing task1Index and task2Index to the pairedTasks array.
14. Return pairedTasks.
15. Create a function called getTaskDurationToIndices that takes in a single parameter, tasks.
16. Create a variable called taskDurationToIndices and set it to an empty object.
17. Create a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of tasks - 1, with i being the index.
18. Create a variable called taskDuration and set it to the value of the tasks array at index i.
19. Create an if statement that checks if the key taskDuration is in the taskDurationToIndices object.
20. If true, push i to the value of the key taskDuration in the taskDurationToIndices object.
21. Otherwise, set the value of the key taskDuration in the taskDurationToIndices object to an array containing i.
22. Return taskDurationToIndices.
23. Create a variable called tasks and set it to an array containing 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4.
24. Create a variable called k and set it to 3.
25. Log the return value of the taskAssignment function, passing in k and tasks as the arguments. */
