Name: Total Waiting Time

* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Sort the array
2. Loop through the array, and for each element, calculate the number of queries left (we subtract 1 because we're looping from 0), and then multiply the number of queries left by the current element.
3. Add the result of the above calculation to a variable called totalWaitingTime, and then return that variable.

Let's say the array is [3, 2, 1, 2, 6].
1. Sort the array -> [1, 2, 2, 3, 6]
2. Loop through the array
	- For 1, there are 4 queries left (5 - 1)
	- For 2, there are 3 queries left (5 - 2)
	- For 2, there are 2 queries left (5 - 3)
	- For 3, there are 1 queries left (5 - 4)
	- For 6, there are 0 queries left (5 - 5)
3. Add up the results of the above calculations
	- 1 * 4 = 4
	- 2 * 3 = 6
	- 2 * 2 = 4
	- 3 * 1 = 3
	- 6 * 0 = 0
	- 4 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 17 */
