Name: Sorted Squares
/* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Create an array that will hold the squares of the given array
2. Create a pointer to the start of the given array
3. Create a pointer to the end of the given array
4. Create a loop that iterates through the array backwards
5. Create a variable that holds the absolute value of the value at the start pointer
6. Create a variable that holds the absolute value of the value at the end pointer
7. If the value at the start pointer is greater than the value at the end pointer
8. Assign the value at the start pointer squared to the end of the array
9. Increment the start pointer
10. Else, assign the value at the end pointer squared to the end of the array
11. Decrement the end pointer
12. Return the array */
