Name: Three Number sum

* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Sort both arrays in ascending order;
2. Initialize two indices: one for array1 and the other for array2;
3. Initialize the smallest and current difference to the maximum integer value;
4. Initialize the smallest pair;
5. While the indices are valid, compare the elements at the indices;
6. If the element in array1 is smaller, increment the index for array1;
7. If the element in array2 is smaller, increment the index for array2;
8. If the elements are equal, return the pair;
9. If the current difference is smaller than the smallest difference, update the smallest difference and the smallest pair;
10. Return the smallest pair. */
