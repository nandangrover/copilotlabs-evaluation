Name: Alphabet Triangle

""" The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. We import the testing package, which is the package that contains functions used for unit testing.
2. We define a function TestPrint. The name of this function must start with Test and take a pointer to a testing.T as a parameter.
3. We store the value of os.Stdout in a variable called rescueStdout. This is where the output from the program will go.
4. We call the function os.Pipe. This returns three values: a Reader, a Writer, and an error. We assign the Writer to a variable called w, and the Reader to a variable called r.
5. We assign the Writer to os.Stdout. Any output from the program will now go to the Writer.
6. We call the invertedStar function, which will print the inverted star pattern to the Writer.
7. We close the Writer.
8. We read the output from the Reader and assign it to the variable s.
9. We assign the original value of os.Stdout to os.Stdout.
10. We remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the output and the expected value.
11. We compare the output and the expected value. If they are not equal, we call the Errorf function on the testing.T parameter. This will cause the test to fail. */
