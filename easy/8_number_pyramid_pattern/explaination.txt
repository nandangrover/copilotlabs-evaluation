Name: Number Pyramid Pattern

/* The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. The function takes a parameter n, which is a number representing the height of the pyramid.
2. The function then runs a for loop, which runs as long as i is less than or equal to n.
3. The for loop contains another for loop, which runs as long as j is less than n-i.
4. The for loop contains a process.stdout.write() method, which prints a space to the screen.
5. The for loop then contains a third for loop, which runs as long as k is less than i.
6. The for loop contains a process.stdout.write() method, which prints the value of i to the screen.
7. The for loop then contains a process.stdout.write() method, which prints a newline character to the screen.
8. The function then calls the pyramidPattern() function, passing in the number 5 as an argument. */
