Name: Check Prime

""" The code above does the following, explained in English:
1. Define a function named is_prime that takes a parameter n.
2. If n is equal to 1, return False, because 1 is not a prime number.
3. If n is not equal to 1, use a for loop to check whether n is divisible by any number between 2 and n.
4. If n is divisible by any number between 2 and n, return False, because n is not a prime number.
5. If n is not divisible by any number between 2 and n, return True, because n is a prime number.
6. Call the function is_prime with the argument 1 and print the result.
7. Call the function is_prime with the argument 17 and print the result. """
